<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>In this Quarto document, we will be analyzing a collection of chat log files from the Conti Ransomware group.</p>
<p>This version of the Quarto document is meant to be usable by students. It should be reproducible, simple to browse, and well-explained. Because the original data set was too large and would cause some of the codes to run more slowly, only a smaller sample of the data set will be used here.</p>
</section>
<section id="data" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="data">Data</h2>
<p>The first code chunk will set the folder or directory that this quarto document will get the data from. Without later specifying a different folder, only the files in this folder can be read, and any files written will be saved in this folder:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb14"><pre class="sourceCode r cell-code code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb14-1"><a href="#cb14-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    knitr<span class="sc">::</span>opts_knit<span class="sc">$</span><span class="fu">set</span>(<span class="at">root.dir =</span> <span class="fu">normalizePath</span>(<span class="st">"C:</span><span class="sc">\\</span><span class="st">Users</span><span class="sc">\\</span><span class="st">jliu2</span><span class="sc">\\</span><span class="st">Documents</span><span class="sc">\\</span><span class="st">conti_all_fixed"</span>))</span></code><button title="Copy to Clipboard" class="code-copy-button"><i class="bi"></i></button></pre></div>
</div>
<p>Please replace the directory inside quotation marks with the directory of the folder where your chat log files are, replacing single backslashes with double backslashes. We can used the <em>getwd()</em> function to check what folder we are in. If the code above does not work, then we can go to the <em>Tools</em> tab, <em>Global Options</em>, and change the default working directory.</p>
<p>The original data set had 393 files. These files are all json files. Using the <em>sample()</em> function, we will only extract data from 39 of them.</p>
<p>We want to make a combined data frame from those 39 json files. Thus, we will make a loop to go through each file, obtain their data in the form of data frames, and combine them by rows using the <em>rbind()</em> function.</p>
<p>We can get these data frames by turning the json files into tibbles, and then unnesting them.</p>
<p>A tibble is a type of data frame within R. When used on our json files, the tibble function produces a column of nested named lists within its cells. The data within these lists aren’t put out in the open to be seen. By unnesting the tibble wider, the data inside each named list will be spread into columns and can be seen.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="encrypted-text">Encrypted Text</h2>
<p>There is likely text in the data set that was encrypted. We would not want this text to affect the results of some of our later text analyses, but neither do we want to ignore their existence. Therefore, we will replace those encrypted messages with null values <em>(NA)</em> that exist but have nothing inside.</p>
<p>From the entire data set, there are 2 strings among the messages that represent encrypted text:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>“The message is encrypted and cannot be decrypted”</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>“This message is encrypted, and you are unable to decrypt it”</em></p></li>
</ul>
<p>The common part between them is <em>“message is encrypted”</em>, so this is the string that will be used to detect which messages in the data set are encrypted when dealing with the encrypted messages.</p>

<p>In this data set, there are some types of addresses that may give some interesting or valuable information about the participants in the hacker group:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>YouTube video addresses</p></li>
<li><p>non-onion extension email addresses</p></li>
<li><p>BitCoin wallet addresses</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The YouTube addresses in the data set may be of interest because they can tell us what the members of the hacker group are interested in.</p>

<p>Note: Because there is a relatively small number of youtube addresses in the entire data set, it is possible that no youtube addresses will be obtain from the random sample of rows. In that case, we can re-run the codes above for a new and different sample.</p>
<p>We are interested in users of non-onion extension email addresses because they could possibly be easier to track down than users of onion extension email addresses.</p>

<p>Note: There are also not many of these non-onion email addresses in the entire data set, so it is possible that no addresses will be obtain from the random sample of rows.</p>
<p>We are interested in BitCoin Wallet addresses because it may be possible to use them to find their owners; That would require a database that matches the Bitcoin Wallet addresses to their owners, which unfortunately, is not publically available.</p>
<p>The regular expression used in the following code chunk to extract Bitcoin Wallet addresses is from this webpage: <em>https://blog.finxter.com/a-regex-to-match-bitcoin-addresses/#:~:text=A%20regular%20expression%20for%20validating,doesn’t%20contain%20ambiguous%20characters</em></p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="frequency-analysis">Frequency Analysis</h2>
<p>By “Frequency Analysis”, we are referring to the how often terms appear in documents, or “<em>Term Frequency</em>”. But how often a word appears, does not always show how important it is.</p>
<p>It is said that “<em>tf_idf</em>”, the <em>product</em> of <em>term frequency</em> and <em>inverse document frequency</em>, which decreases for words that are more commonly in the documents and increases for words that are more rarely used, can be used to rank the importance of the terms.</p>
<p>To begin calculating tf_idf, we need a data frame with columns that contain: words, the number of each word, and something that groups the words (Ex. Documents that groups of words are from)</p>

<p>Another way to look at these bigrams is by making them into a <em>Network</em>, a vizualization/graph that shows the relationships between terms.</p>
<p>A Network can have:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Nodes: Points on the graph that represent each term</p></li>
<li><p>Links: lines that represent a connection between the two terms, or arrows that show which term precedes or follows the other</p></li>
</ul>
<p>And it requires 3 variables for its construction:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>from: which will be used to set the node where an arrow line will come from</p></li>
<li><p>to: which will be used to set the node where the arrow line will go to</p></li>
<li><p>weight: the number associated with each relationship. It can be used to show which from-to relationship is greater or less than others</p></li>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="interactive-network">Interactive Network</h2>
<p>It is also possible for network visualizations to become <em>interactive</em>, allowing real-time manipulation of the visualization. An interactive network would be more useful when trying to find “person-to-person” relationships between the members of the hacker group.</p>
<p>We will be creating an <em>interactive network</em> to show which hackers sent the most messages in the group, and to who. The package we will be using is <em>visNetwork</em>, which requires 2 data frames made in very specific ways.</p>
<p>One of which is a data frame called “edges”, with columns “from” &amp; “to”, to tell it which nodes to connect:</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="topic-modeling">Topic Modeling</h2>
<p>Topic modeling is a form of unsupervised classification, similar to clustering. It finds probabilities that terms can be related to the same topic.</p>
<p>The <em>LDA()</em> (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) function, from the <em>topicmodel</em> package, can be used to make a topic model. We will see if this model can successfully separate the words in the hackers’ messages into obvious topics. But to use this function, we must input into a <em>document-term matrix</em>.</p>
