# DHS-CINA-research-project
A research project performed during participation in the Department of Homeland Security's summer (2022) research program at the Criminal Investigations and Network Analysis Center

Used the R programming language to perform a comprehensive data analysis of chat logs from a ransomware group

Some of the code was reproduced in Python, along with some code based off of a project done by a Microsoft 365 Defender Research Team.

This project was done in RStudio, in Quarto documents, which can be used to produce html files with both the code and the text inside them, to be viewed in a web browser. The html files produced by the code were also included, but will need to be downloaded before opening to properly view the html page. The student-friendly versions of the code use smaller samples of the data set to be able to run the code faster and may be missing some longer blocks of code that the original version had.

A html presentation was made, including the information, theories, and conclusions, found by the 3 members of our research team.
